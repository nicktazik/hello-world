# hello-world
This is Nick's hello world repository on GitHub

This is the first line of text in my first README edit. It appears on line 4 of the code.

This is the second line of text, but it appears on line 6 of the code. It's separated from the first line with an empty, so I wonder what that looks like. 
This is the third line, on 7. No extra space. What does that mean???
I hope this README was helpful.
From, Nick.
